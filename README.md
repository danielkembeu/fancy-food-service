# Fancy Restaurant
### A WEB Service for Restaurants

This is a learning project built for demonstrating how sweet is the backend Development.
These are the steps we followed to achieve the goals:
- **Project Analysis** : Which consists of determining the actors, the tables and all the relationships between them.
- **Building the database** : After the analysis, we did have now a ready to use database.
- **Configuring the Database environment** : This step consists of configuring the database using the Prisma ORM, a relational database and creating all the interfaces needed for the project.
- **Configure the NodeJS express app** : We now have a ready to use database, then we can start thinking about the routing and and API itself. For that we'll use [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com)
- **Services**: A service is a utility function that performs a specific action. It's mostly for good project's architecture needs. Will start by creating all the services related to the application.
- **Controllers**: We'll then have to create the actions that will be executed when a particular route is matched.
